Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine




##Objectives 

	- Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

	- Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

	- Connect between the two instances.

#STEPS

1. Create a virtual machine using the GCP Console

		gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-1"  --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud"
		
		--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213"--subnet "default"


2. Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line
	
	- display a list of all the zones in the region to which Qwiklabs assigned you to make selection

		gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1


	- Choose a zone from that list other than the zone to which Qwiklabs assigned you
		
		gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b


3. Create a VM instance called my-vm-2 in that zone:

		gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" 

		--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default"


4. Close the Cloud Shell:

		exit


5. Connect between VM instances:

	- Explore the two vm instances just created on Google Cloud Platform Console(GCP):

		gcloud compute instances list


6. Open command prompt on the my-vm-2 instance, that is SSH in its row into VM 2. 

		gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2 --zone=us-central1-b


7. Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:

		ping my-vm-1


	- Press Cntl+C to stop the ping


8. Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:  

		ssh my-vm-1


9. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:

		sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y


10. Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:

		sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html


11. Move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header and edit the text

		Hi from YOUR_NAME


12. Confirm that the web server is serving your new page:

		curl http://localhost/


13. Exit the command prompt on my-vm-1: 

		exit


14. Confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2:


		curl http://my-vm-1/

15. On GCP console, Navigation menu, Vm instances

		gcloud compute instances list


16. Copy the External IP address for my-vm-1 and paste it into the address bar of a new browser
