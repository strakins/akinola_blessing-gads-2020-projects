AK8S-05 Upgrading Kubernetes Engine Clusters



##Objectives
	- In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

	- Use the GCP Console to upgrade your GKE cluster.

1. Deploy a GKE cluster
	
	- In the GCP Console, on the Navigation menu, Kubenetes, Clusters:


	- Click the Master version drop down menu to expand the list of available Kubernetes versions:

		gcloud container get-server-config


	- Create clusters

		gcloud beta container clusters create "cluster-1" --zone "us-central1-c" --master --cluster-version "1.14.10-gke.27"


			
2. From the GCP Console, on the Navigation menu, in the Kubernetes Engine section, click Clusters to view:

		gcloud container clusters list
	


3. Upgrade your GKE cluster:
	
	- In the GCP Console, Navigation menu, in the Kubernetes Engine section, click Clusters:

	- To the right of the master version, click the Upgrade available link to start the upgrade wizard:

		gcloud container clusters upgrade cluster-1 --master --cluster-version="1.15.11-gke.5"

	
	- When the master upgrade has completed, the master version number changes to the version that you 
	  selected in the upgrade wizard (list clusters to confirm)
		
		gcloud container clusters list
	

4.Upgrade the node pool in your cluster

	- You must now upgrade the nodes of your cluster to the same version as the master.

	- Refresh your web browser to display the prompt, and then click Upgrade oldest node pool.

		gcloud container node-pools list --cluster=cluster-1


5. In the upgrade wizard window, choose the most recent version  and then click Change to continue with the upgrade

		gcloud container clusters upgrade clusters


6. When all of the nodes have been upgraded the new version is reflected in the node pool details pane:
	
	- To confirm: 

		gcloud container node-pools list --cluster=cluster-1
